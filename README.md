# Atlyas-Carousel-View
Paginated carousel view with dynamic content size


**Steps to use:- **

-> Download the zip file or clone the repository to run the app.
-> Just run the app it will show the carousel view


**CONTENTS:- **

- Views:- Carousel view and Indicator view 

Description:- 
Carousal view is the main paginated scroll view with the required animation and property.
Indicator view is a below dotted view which tells the number of image and current selected image.

**Requirement covered:- **

1- Replicated only the carousel view along with the page control in SwiftUI.
2- Carousel view is paginated (i.e. when you lift your finger it should center to the nearest tile.)
3- The image in the middle should zoom as it comes to the center. 
4- Specifically if you scroll slowly, it should behave very smoothly. No erratic behaviour.
5- can use any inbuilt views but no third-party libraries.
6- When the view appears on the screen, the middle image should be visible on the screen and zoomed-in. 
7- The carousel view should be easily extensible i.e., if were to add 4 more images to it, it should not take more than 15 mins.
8- 6. The default height of the carousel view can be around 250 points and carousel items have to be of 1:1 aspect ratio. 
9. The height should not be fixed. Which means I were to add some fixed height views at the top and bottom the carousel view should resize itself (i.e., make itself smaller). 
10. In continuation to the above, the view should not overlap any view at the top and bottom if they are added.


Note:-  As mentioned this supports ios version 17 and above.
